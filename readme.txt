The functioning of a neural network with radial basis functions has been studied. A model of the Boolean function (!x1+x3)x2 + x2x4 based on RBF-HC with binary inputs x1-x4=(0,1), a unit bias input equal to 1, synaptic weights v1-v4, binary output y=(0, 1) with a threshold activation function of the output neuron, hidden RBF neurons with a Gaussian activation function and coordinates of centers c1-c4.
